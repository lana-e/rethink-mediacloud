# rethink-mediacloud
Repo for ReThink's MediaCloud API for use in its 9/11 endless war coverage project. Objectives include:
- Create custom news outlet lists to search (e.g. ReThink’s standard Novetta media outlet lists)
- Output “news hole” line graphs (see Normalizing within a Source in the Attention notebook)
- Use word counts to create word clouds, maybe topic modeling/tf-idf to compare queries? 
- Webscraping to fetch full text of articles from the urls?
